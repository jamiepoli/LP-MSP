## Notes about this repository

This repository is a conglomerate holding all manner of data related to my MATH 340 project, a course I am taking in the 2nd winter term of 2021-2021. There is a jupyter notebook giving a consolidated report on my analysis on the topic of marine spatial planning, through a linear programming lens. All of the code handled here is of my creation. 

The full written report of my project is not included in this repo.
